Scope: UI/layout only. Update templates + CSS.
DO NOT change backend routes, database models, API behavior, vote logic, or transition logic.
Keep API vote values exactly "UP" and "DOWN". Keep toggle behavior where sending vote: null clears.

A) Feed (templates/feed.html)
1) Remove the separate “Shortlisted: X / Passed: Y” line.
2) Make the two signal buttons include counts:
   - "Shortlist · {pursue_count}" (show ✓ if selected)
   - "Pass · {pass_count}" (show ✓ if selected)
3) Layout: left side = Shortlist + Pass buttons.
   Right side = Save button + Details link.
4) Make “Details” a text link styled with a .details-link class, not a filled button.
5) Ensure layout wraps cleanly on mobile under 640px (no overflow).

B) Decisions page (templates/saved.html)
1) Keep tabs Shortlist / Bid / No Bid.
2) Replace the “Shortlist X / Pass Y” row with:
   “Signals — Shortlist · X  Pass · Y”
   Make this subtle (small text, not bold headline).
3) Layout actions like Feed:
   - Left: Go Bid / No Bid buttons (only when state_filter == 'saved')
   - Right: Details link styled consistently with Feed.
4) Fix badge CSS mismatch so Shortlisted / Go Bid / No Bid badges render properly using existing styles or minimal aliases.

C) Opportunity Detail page (the template used for /opportunity/<id>)
Reorganize layout into a clean two-column structure on desktop:

Top:
- Title + type badge row

Below:
- Two-column grid
  Left column (primary content):
    - Opportunity Brief card
    - Original SAM.gov description (accordion) below it
  Right column (secondary content):
    - Key Info card with:
      Agency
      Due date (+ days left, keep urgency styling)
      Posted date
      NAICS
      Set-aside (if present)
      SAM.gov ID
      Internal deadline (if present)

On mobile (<=640px):
- Stack everything vertically
- Key Info above Brief

UI requirements:
- Use existing design system (cards, spacing, colors).
- Make “Generate AI Brief” a secondary-style button.
- Do not introduce new frameworks.
- Do not modify data fields, only reorganize layout.

D) CSS (static/css/styles.css)
Add only minimal new classes needed for:
- .actions-left / .actions-right layout
- .details-link styling
- Two-column detail page grid that collapses under 640px
Keep styling consistent with existing palette and shadows.

Acceptance criteria:
- No duplicate “Shortlist / Pass” labels on Feed cards.
- Counts live inside buttons on Feed.
- Decisions page shows subtle “Signals — …” line.
- Detail page looks organized and intentional.
- No backend behavior changes.
