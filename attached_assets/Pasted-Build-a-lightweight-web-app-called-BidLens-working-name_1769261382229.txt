Build a lightweight web app called “BidLens” (working name) that helps small businesses triage SAM.gov Contract Opportunities. The app is decision-first: calm UI, short default lists, and stateful “Saved” items that show up on a simple calendar view. It must not feel like a dense filter/database UI.

Tech stack:
- Backend: Python FastAPI
- Frontend: server-rendered HTML templates (Jinja2) OR a simple React frontend (choose the simplest for speed). Keep UI clean and card-based (not a dense table).
- DB: SQLite for MVP (with a clear path to Postgres). Use SQLAlchemy.
- Auth: Email-only magic link (no passwords). For MVP, implement “dev mode auth” (enter email, create session) to avoid email provider integration; structure code so real magic links can be added later.
- Payments: Stub only (no Stripe yet). Implement gating logic using a boolean “is_paid” field on user for now.

Core domain model:
- Opportunity: global records ingested from SAM.gov (or stub data for now)
- UserOpportunity: per-user state for an opportunity (saved/tracked/status/internal_deadline/notes)

Data model (minimum):
1) opportunities
- id (internal)
- sam_notice_id (unique string)
- title
- agency
- opportunity_type (e.g., “Solicitation”, “RFI”, “Sources Sought”)
- posted_date (date)
- response_deadline (date)
- naics (string, nullable)
- set_aside (string, nullable)
- description (text, nullable)
- sam_url (string)
- created_at / updated_at

2) users
- id
- email (unique)
- is_paid (bool default false)
- created_at

3) user_opportunities
- id
- user_id (fk)
- opportunity_id (fk)
- status (enum/string: “saved”, “in_progress”, “dropped”)
- internal_deadline (date, nullable)
- notes (text, nullable)
- created_at / updated_at

Core UX and pages:
1) Home / Feed page
- Default view: “Solicitations” tab selected.
- Secondary tab: “RFIs & Sources Sought”.
- Each tab shows a calm feed of opportunity cards (max ~20 items by default).
- Sorting: by response_deadline ascending (urgency).
- Each card shows: title, agency, due date (absolute + “due in X days”), set-aside badge (if present), NAICS (small), and a clear type badge.
- Primary action per card: “Save” (creates/updates user_opportunities with status=saved). Also allow “Drop” once saved.
- Include a subtle control: “Show me everything” that expands to paginated/full list within the current tab (still sorted by deadline). This is not the default.

2) Opportunity detail page
- Shows key fields + description + link to SAM.gov.
- Buttons: Save / Unsave (or Drop), Set internal deadline, Add notes.
- Keep it minimal.

3) Saved page (or “My Bids”)
- List of saved opportunities with status and internal deadline.
- Filters: status (saved/in_progress/dropped) and tab type (Solicitation vs RFI)
- Link to detail page.

4) Calendar page
- Shows ONLY saved solicitations (not RFIs) by default.
- Calendar can be very simple: a list grouped by week/month OR a basic calendar grid.
- Each saved solicitation appears on the date = internal_deadline if set, else response_deadline.
- Clicking an item opens the detail page.

Key product rules:
- Default feed must feel curated by being short (limit ~20). Users can expand with “Show me everything.”
- RFIs/Sources Sought must be separated from solicitations via tab.
- No heavy onboarding. User lands on feed first after login.
- Preferences are not required for MVP.

Data ingestion:
- For MVP, seed the database with ~30 stub opportunities in a script.
- Structure the code to later add a SAM.gov ingestion job (do not implement the real API calls yet unless easy).
- Include an admin-only endpoint or script to refresh/replace stub opportunities.

Quality requirements:
- Clean folder structure.
- Use environment variables for config.
- Provide a README with run instructions.
- Keep UI extremely friendly, whitespacey, and calm. Avoid dense tables.

Deliverables:
- Working app with the pages above.
- Seed script for opportunities.
- Basic session auth.
- CRUD actions for save/internal deadline/notes/status.
